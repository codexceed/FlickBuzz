An android app to check out latest movies, reviews and ratings.

The App will display a grid of posters sorted either by popularity of the respective movies or their ratings(popularity by default).
On Tapping on a postr, the movie details will be displayed.

NOTE: The API key for The Movie Database API has been removed and will need to be generated by every unique user by signing up on this link:
https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup
The key value needs to be inserted in the "strings.xml" file located in the "res/values/" directory. The string name would be "api_key_val"
